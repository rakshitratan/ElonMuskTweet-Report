<H1> Elon Musk Tweet Report </H1>

<h3> I have Visualised, Elon Musk most influential tweets of 2021 and the effect of those tweets on the Share market. </h3>

>>I have Visualised, Elon Musk most influential tweets of 2021 and the effect of those tweets on the Share market. <p> I used Python to scrape the Twitter data, which was then used to create the 'Data.csv' file. And relevant stock prices were scraped from 'yahoofinance.com' using python(They are in the Data folder).
  
The data collected was then used to create two datasets named 'After.csv' & 'Before.csv' which was the stock price before and after the tweet respectively.
<H2> The dataset was then used to create a report in PowerBI. The .pbix file can be found attached. </H2>
